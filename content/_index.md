Hello! I'm a software engineer passionate about systems programming, performance, and building tools that make developers' lives easier.

I spend most of my time working with Rust and C, exploring the boundaries between high-level abstractions and low-level control. When I'm not coding, I enjoy writing about what I learn and sharing it with the community.

This blog is where I document my journey, share tutorials, and explore interesting technical problems.
